## What is KeyDB

KeyDB is a high performance database with a focus on multithreading, memory efficiency, and high throughput. We offer the ability to scale both vertically and horizontally, with several replication options including multi-master replication which can be used cross-region.

KeyDB leverages its power and architecture to provide features that might not otherwise be possible with a single threaded engine such as Redis. KeyDB can be used as a drop in alternative to Redis and maintains compatibility with the Redis API, modules, protocol and clients.

## Requests

If you have a request for spcecific documentation it is likely youre not the only one. Please create an issue in the [KeyDB-docs repository](https://github.com/benschermel/KeyDB-docs) and we will put it in the queue.

## Contributions

If you have a markdown tutorial/demonstration/instruction you would like us to post please create a pull request on the [KeyDB-docs Github repository](https://github.com/benschermel/KeyDB-docs).

## Community

Please [join our community forum](https://community.keydb.dev/) where you can reach out directly with other KeyDB users.


## KeyDB Pro

[KeyDB Pro](https://keydb.dev/keydb-pro.html) is intended to finance and support the development of KeyDB which will remain open source. All pro features will be kept in a separate binary to differentiate it from our open source distribution

[KeyDB Pro](https://keydb.dev/keydb-pro.html) can be downloaded [here](https://keydb.dev/downloads.html). KeyDB Pro offers powerful features that can help reduce TCO. Major architectural changes have enabled features such as MVCC, persistent FLASH, non-blocking queries, forkless background saving, and others.

There is a specific section of Docs dedicated to Pro specific features. Because KeyDB Pro is a superset of open source KeyDB, all other docs will be applicable to both the open source and Pro editions.
