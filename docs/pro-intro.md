## KeyDB Professional Docs

This section of docs houses all documentation relating specifically to KeyDB Pro. As such all sections outside of this also relate to the Pro version but also to the Open Source version. 

## About KeyDB Professional 

KeyDB-Pro is not your typical enterprise database product. Today nearly everyone uses a database, and the old enterprise model is complex and unaffordable for most. Startups, small business and developers need easy access to powerful solutions, and this is what we provide with KeyDB-Pro.

We want to enable simple and affordable solutions that don’t require complex or lock-in sales tactics. Our product costs a fraction of Redis Enterprise while offering powerful features that will surpass other enterprise offerings. Our philosophy is simple, times are changing and the masses need an affordable, user-friendly product thats easy to get and easy to use. With KeyDB, you will be able to  start eliminating the need for multiple databases and greatly reduce the complexity of your setup. Scaling and high availability becomes easier and less complex with a lot less moving parts to maintain.

## What Makes KeyDB-Pro Different from other NOSQL databases?

KeyDB-Pro lets you have your cake and eat it too. You may ask, can I get true persistence, durability guarantees and ACID compliance at 5x the speed of a cache database such as Redis? Yes. You can.

KeyDB is a powerful database that enables you to do more. KeyDB enables for a much larger individual node size to be used. Use of transactions, multiple DBs, etc (features used without clustering) require larger node sizes and this becomes possible with vertical scaling with KeyDB. With mvcc you can take advantage of transactions, heavy queries, and forkless background saving without killing performance. We are able to allocate to separate asynchronous worker threads to help use the resources at hand. 

There are no more tradeoffs between perf and durability. KeyDB is so fast, and with new persistence options + MVCC KeyDB becomes ACID compliant. KeyDB is becoming a bridge between cache and traditional databases enabling many customers to require only one database.			

KeyDB is architected for the future and keeps up to date with the latest tech. We move fast and are becoming a disruptive force in the database market. KeyDBpro is taking the evolution of databases to a new level. We are in the process of pumping features into PRO. Currently mvcc, FLASH and coming soon in Q1 2020 we will be releasing PMEM options and compression options.

## A better Redis? Yes.

KeyDB is 5x faster than Redis. KeyDB keeps up to date with the latest from Redis to include features and maintain its compatibility. KeyDB as such is a drop in replacement product for Redis and the best alternative on the market.

Features such as MVCC and “memory access app direct mode” for Optane PMEM are features that require large architectural changes and they likely will not be incorporated to Redis’ base code. Nor are they easy to make as a module. 

KeyDB-community version (open-source) started as a fork of redis and contains all Redis has to offer but with many powerful features Redis doesn’t offer. KeyDB-Pro takes it to the next level and will remain affordable to everyone, not just the big guys.

## No Commitment or Vendor Lock-in 

KeyDB remains fully compatible with Redis API, Modules, Protocol. We work with Redis clients and are a drop in replacement for your current Redis deployment. If you develop with KeyDB, your efforts still enable you to change to Redis (minus KeyDB specific features). There are no contracts with KeyDB-Pro and we offer you the ability to pay monthly enabling you to cancel at any time. Annual offerings are also available for those who prefer.

Please reach out to us for more information

## Channel Partners

For those hosting KeyDB or offering it as a service, the KeyDB-Pro offering will enable major savings for the end user or allow increased margins. Persistence options help minimize HA resources and compression & FLASH options enable major memory savings. If you would like to become an official channel partner with KeyDB/KeyDB-Pro please contact us support@keydb.dev to discuss licensing and support options.
