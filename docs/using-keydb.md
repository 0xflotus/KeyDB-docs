This database is a high performance fork of redis, with the core set of functions remaining the same ([see explanation here](https://github.com/JohnSully/KeyDB)). This enables you to use KeyDB the same as you would Redis but with the advantage of performance gains and simplified setup/configuration options. 

KeyDB remains up to date with the current version of Redis and as such maintains compatibility with standard Redis API's and protocols. Front-end tools, redis-cli, API's and modules will work with KeyDB. KeyDB can be dropped in place with only KeyDBs new features requiring configuration.

Docs presented here look to outlay modification uses not already outlined in Redis or tools related to Redis.
