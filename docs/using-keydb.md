## Compatability

KeyDB remains up to date with the current version of Redis and as such maintains compatibility with standard Redis API's and protocols. Front-end tools, redis clients, API's and modules will work with KeyDB. KeyDB is a drop in alternative to Redis. You can see more in [migration](https://docs.keydb.dev/docs/migration)

KeyDB is compatible with all Redis clients as listed [here](https://redis.io/clients) so this should not be a concern. Simply use your client as you would with Redis.

## Run on Docker

### Install Docker

If you havent installed docker you can install with `$ sudo apt-get install docker docker.io`

### Run KeyDB

Pull the latest KeyDB docker image with `$sudo docker pull eqalpha/keydb`. Alternatively, if you start by using the run command, docker will pull the latest image prior to running. The basic run command will be `$ sudo docker run eqalpha/keydb`

You will likely want to customize your configuration on startup. You can find out more on our [docker page](https://hub.docker.com/r/eqalpha/keydb). We will go over a few examples here on launching docker containers:

## Using KeyDB

### Launching an Instance
```
$ docker run -p 6379:6379 --name mycontainername -d eqalpha/keydb keydb-server /etc/keydb/keydb.conf --requirepass mypassword 
```
Here we launched a container with name 'mycontainername', it was launched in 'detached' mode to run in the background, we specified the repository 'eqalpha/keydb', followed by calling the program 'keydb-server' and referencing the config file with an update to the 'requirepass' parameter. keydb-server will launch by default if a program is not otherwise specified. You have to specify the program if you plan to pass in additional parameters.

### Launching Pro
```
$ docker run -p 6379:6379 --name mycontainername -d eqalpha/keydb keydb-server /etc/keydb/keydb.conf --enable-pro [license-key]
```
OR
```
docker run -p 6379:6379 --name mycontainername -d eqalpha/keydb-pro keydb-pro-server /etc/keydb/keydb.conf --enable-pro [license-key]
```
KeyDB pro is part of the community docker image. If you do not have a license key you can use it in trial mode for 120 minutes after which time you will have to restart it. If you have a license key you can enter it here or speicfy it in your configuration file (see more [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/eqalpha/keydb).

### Launching Enhanced FLASH
```
sudo docker run -p 6379:6379 -d -it --name mycontainername --mount type=bind,dst=/flash,src=/path/to/flash/ eqalpha/keydb-pro keydb-pro-server --enable-pro [license-key] --storage-provider flash /flash --maxmemory [maxmemory-amount-ie. 500M] --mexmemory-policy [eviction-policy ie. allkeys-lfu]
```
This launches Pro with FLASH storage. Specify your flash location, mount it, and specify the appropriate configuration parameters. You can see more [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/eqalpha/keydb-pro).

### Connect with keydb-cli

you can grab the ip of the container with docker inspect --format '{{ .NetworkSettings.IPAddress }}' mycontainername then run the following:
```
docker run -it --rm eqalpha/keydb keydb-cli -h <ipaddress-from-above> -p 6379
```
The 'rm' parameter removes the container when you are done with it

## Using the KeyDB PPA

Please see [this article](https://docs.keydb.dev/docs/ppa-deb/) for more details on our PPA and using deb packages. However in order to use the PPA its as simple as:
```
$ sudo curl -s --compressed -o /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/keydb.gpg https://download.keydb.dev/keydb-ppa/keydb.gpg
$ sudo curl -s --compressed -o /etc/apt/sources.list.d/keydb.list https://download.keydb.dev/keydb-ppa/keydb.list
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install keydb
```

### Launching an Instance

```
$ keydb-server --port 6379 --requirepass mypassword --server-threads 7
```
Here we launched keydb-server and passed in parameters to the default config file. You can also specify the configuration file which you may have already customized
```
$ keydb-server ./path/to/config/keydb.conf
```

### Launching Pro

You can either specify keydb-server to run the pro binary: `keydb-server --enable-pro [license-key]` or you can just call the pro binary directly `keydb-pro-server`

If you do not have a license key you can use it in trial mode for 120 minutes after which time you will have to restart it. If you have a license key you can enter it here or speicfy it in your configuration file

### Launching Enhanced FLASH
```
keydb-pro-server --enable-pro [license-key] --storage-provider  flash  [path-to-flash-storage] 
```
Note that if maxmemory and eviction policy are not set, they will default to `maxmemory [half the available RAM]` and `maxmemory-policy allkeys-lru`

Feel free to specify yourself on launch by `--maxmemory [max-memory-for-DRAMâ€¦ ie. 500mb or 1G] --maxmemory-policy allkeys-lru`

In your config file you will find descriptions of each parameter used above. You can also find out more about using Enhanced FLASH [here]( https://docs.keydb.dev/docs/pro-flash/)

### Connect with keydb-cli
```
$ keydb-cli -h 127.0.0.1 -p 6379
```

## Build Community KeyDB

Take a look at our docs on [building KeyDB (Open Source)](https://docs.keydb.dev/docs/build/). Once you have installed the binaries (`make install`) you can simply call the program at the command line `keydb-server`. You will want to specify you directory location, logfile location, and .conf location. 

Once installed you can remove the project folder you cloned but make sure to copy 'keydb.conf' from the top level directory into a location of your choice.

## Coming soon

In the near future KeyDB will be hosting deb and rmp packages for several different builds as well as more binary downloads for different builds. Each method will support KeyDB Pro
