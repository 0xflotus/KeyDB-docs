# KeyDB Doc's

## [This repo is no longer being updated with content. Please check out KeyDB-Docs section on our website which is more user friendly and now being updated with additional content.](https://keydb.dev/docs/intro). If you feel like contributing documentation you can still make a PR here or send a markdown copy to support@eqalpha.com. Webpage is much easier to navigate

*please keep in mind this repo is in its early stages and will be changing a lot over the next few weeks as its populated. So please  mind any minor mistakes and lack of info*

This repo is meant for anyone using KeyDB and its content will in large part be based off your feedback and input. If you have a specific request please let us know and we will see if we can help out. If one person has a question its likely others will as well.

Regarding documentation, seeing as this database is a fork of Redis, a lot of extensive documentation can be found already online. With this repo we are looking more for use-cases, examples, and will post literature on topics specifically related to KeyDB. Supplemental files we use for our images are also posted. 

If you have an interesting use case you would like to share please create a PR and we would be happy to integrate. This repo is to both help our users and better understand your needs.
