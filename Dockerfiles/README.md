# Dockerfiles for KeyDB

### We are posting our Dockerfiles so you can see what you are getting on your pull request, also so you are able to modify and customize to your needs. Let us know if there is a specific image you would find valuable to have posted. We do maintain our docker images.

### These are the current Dockerfiles used for our EQAlpha Docker Images. The Dockerfiles are manifested so when they are pulled the correct image is obtained.

### The Docker_Build Dcokerfile can be used to generat binaries from the latest github clone if you are looking to try out the build prior to an official release.
